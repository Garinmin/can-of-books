# Start your own "Can of Books" App

This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Collaboration

### Logistical

Available: 11am - 7pm
Communication service: Slack
Breaks: 1 per hour
Plan if someone starts to fall behind: Spend extra time with the person who is behind

### Cooperative

Rinat's Strengths: Backend server logic
Cullen's Strenghts: Accountability
Plan to utilize our strengths: Divide the project into parts by strength
Approach to day-to-day: Start with code review, circle back near the end of the day

### Conflict Resolution

If someone is not doing their part we'll bring it to the member's attention, and encourage them to put in more effort. Repeat offense will get more serious.

If someone is taking over the project, we'll talk to them about letting off.

We'll use code reviews and appropriate communcation to ensure understanding accross the group. If anyone needs more help, they can get it within limits.
